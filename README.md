# ecommerce-group-project

**** Its not a real ecommerce website but just an implementation. ****

This was actually a college group project.
This is an ecommerce site where we have implemented html, css, bootstrap, js, php and mysql.

--> connection.php is included in all other php files and is helps to connect files with database.
--> addcart.php is the page where clients want to add products for their further purchase.
--> checklogin.php checks whether the entered id and password actually exists in database.If exists, then it let us shop otherwise 
    just gives a denying message.
--> feedback.php stores all the feedback from customers and help to store it in database.
--> login.php as the name suggests is a login form page.
--> index.php is the home page of the website.
--> signup.php as the name suggests is the sign up page.
--> order.php puts the products to the order list.
